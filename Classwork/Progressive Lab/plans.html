                            <!-- TODO work on future plans -->
                            <p> My plans after I graduate really hinge on what I do at my time in school.
                                My main plan is to get a good internship through Neumont's career program, which wil hopefully lead me to working for that company full time
                                This could mean staying in salt lake and working here, but I'm kind of hoping to be able to work remotely, or being able to transfer somewhere else, as I don't really want to live here forever.
                                If, per chance, I don't get hired through an internship at Neumont, my other plan is to try my hand at being a contracting developer, which was my inital plan if I didn't get into college.
                                Overall, despite what happens, I plan to move into a place with my boyfriend somewhere in the western part of the US.
